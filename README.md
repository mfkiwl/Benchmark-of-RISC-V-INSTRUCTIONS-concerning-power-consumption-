# Benchmark-of-RISC-V-INSTRUCTIONS-concerning-power-consumption!
aim is straight forward -> the power analysis of each RISC-V instructions ! such that in future an extremely superior RISC-V ISA core can be designed , that can give best performance in both prospective -> highest speed during execution of any task and along with lowest power consumption as well !
